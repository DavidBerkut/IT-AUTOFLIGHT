Not all versions of IT-AUTOFLIGHT are drop in compatable.

I recommend checking Help.txt EVERY time you upgrade ITAF, to make sure the aircraft has all the correct code.

Here I will list the versions where you must change something, see Help.txt.

You can see the version in the first line of Nasal/it-autoflight.nas

Starting from Build 20, the thing that breaks drop ins will be stated in each update with the * symbol in front of it.


Milestone 2 Build 22 (No drop in from Build 20 and earlier)
* Ability to adjust VOR/LOC seperatly from regular roll. 

Milestone 2 Build 20 (No drop in from Build 18 and earlier)
* A/T in a seperate file now, so custom A/T systems can be used.
