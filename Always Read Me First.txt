Not all versions of IT-AUTOFLIGHT are drop in compatable.

I recommend checking Help.txt EVERY time you upgrade ITAF, to make sure the aircraft has all the correct code.

Here I will list the versions where you must change something, see Help.txt.

You can see the version in the first line of Nasal/it-autoflight.nas
